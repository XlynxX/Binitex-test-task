# What is this?
This is my binitex test task result.

# Problems/Issues
- Can't show cases and deaths per 1000 people, because i don't know how to get them, should i count them myself?
- There is a problem with filters not showing anything after erasing everything and also i dont know how to clear Datepickers myself on reset button.
- I have avoided the CORS issue simply just by using proxy website, so if proxy will be down it won't work :(.
- Not fully optimized for mobile screens.
- Maybe it will be laggy a bit on slow pcs, because its counting data in realtime.

I really don't want to play for time, so i released unfinished version, but having most of the specs.
